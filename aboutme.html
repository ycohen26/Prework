        <p>
        Hi!  My name is <b>Yossi Cohen</b>.  I am a 35-year-old married father of <em>three</em> beutiful girls.  My wife, Simcha, and I recently celebrated our 10th anniversary on <time>December 17, 2019.</time>
        <br>
        <br>
        My Oldest daughter, Nina, is 6.  Then there's Talya, or Tali.  She's 4.  Lastly, we have Becky, our 7-month-old.  My wife is a nurse so there are many sundays I get to spend with my girls all by myself.  It's always a great time, and I'm so lucky to have it.  
        </p>
        <p id="last">
        I currently spend my days working in account receivables and billing for a skilled nursing healthcare company.  It's ok, but I need <strong>more</strong>!  That's why I'm enrolled in <strong>Actualize</strong>.  I'm looking for a career that will challenge me and keep me engaged and entertaied all day everyday.
